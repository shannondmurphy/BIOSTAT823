It works with plotly, the package that was used in my last blog post, to allow for simple coding of interactive visualizations.  For this dashboard, data from the NSF on doctorate recipients in the United States was used (https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data).  "

    "To get started, I downloaded Anaconda.  This allows me to run a local version of Python to get the app running.  Within Anaconda, I opened up Jupyter notebooks to code this dashboard.  After doing some standard data cleaning using the pandas package, I began to write the code for the web page.  My webpage contains four images in a two-by-two grid with drop down menus for two and radio items for the other two to allow for customization of the graphs and easier interpretation. "
